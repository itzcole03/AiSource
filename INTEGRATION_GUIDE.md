# ✅ Agent Upgrade Integration Guide

Your enhanced agent swarm system is now ready to use! Here's what you have and how to integrate it.

## 🚀 What's Working

### 1. Core Files Ready
- ✅ `working_agent_upgrade.py` - The main upgrade system with memory and retry logic
- ✅ `integration_patch.py` - Example integration and test functions
- ✅ `prompt_profiles/agent_prompt_profiles.json` - Agent personality profiles (auto-created)
- ✅ `data/memory/agent_memory.json` - Agent memory cache (auto-created)

### 2. Key Features Working
- ✅ Memory-aware prompts per agent
- ✅ Retry logic with fallback models
- ✅ Agent learning from task history
- ✅ Smart prompt templates per role
- ✅ Auto-detection of your LLM managers (17 LM Studio + 14 Ollama models detected!)

## 🛠️ How to Integrate Into Your Project

### Option 1: Drop-in Replacement (Easiest)

In your `run_swarm.py`, find this section around line 138:
```python
# OLD CODE:
if hasattr(agent, 'process_task'):
    result = await agent.process_task(task, context)
    logger.info(f"{agent_name} completed {task_type}")
    return result
```

Replace it with:
```python
# NEW ENHANCED CODE:
from working_agent_upgrade import dispatch_enhanced_task

async def enhanced_run_agent_task(agent_name, task_type, context):
    task_description = f"Perform {task_type} analysis on workspace: {context.get('workspace_path', 'current directory')}"
    
    result = await dispatch_enhanced_task(agent_name, task_description, context)
    
    if result.get("success"):
        logger.info(f"✅ {agent_name} completed {task_type}")
        return {
            "agent": agent_name,
            "summary": f"Completed {task_type} successfully",
            "result": result.get("result", "Task completed"),
            "plan": result.get("result", "No detailed plan available")
        }
    else:
        logger.warning(f"⚠️ {agent_name} had issues with {task_type}")
        return {
            "agent": agent_name,
            "summary": f"Issues with {task_type}: {result.get('error', 'Unknown error')}",
            "error": result.get('error')
        }
```

### Option 2: Test First (Recommended)

1. **Test the system:**
   ```bash
   python working_agent_upgrade.py
   python integration_patch.py
   ```

2. **Run enhanced swarm test:**
   ```bash
   python integration_patch.py
   ```

3. **When ready, modify your run_swarm.py to use enhanced agents**

## 🧠 What Each Agent Does Now

| Agent | Role | Specialized For | Memory Focus |
|-------|------|----------------|--------------|
| **architect** | System Architect | Code structure, design patterns, SOLID principles | Architecture decisions, refactoring patterns |
| **backend** | Backend Developer | API design, database, performance, security | Backend best practices, optimization strategies |
| **frontend** | Frontend Developer | UI/UX, responsive design, modern frameworks | Frontend patterns, user experience improvements |
| **qa** | QA Engineer | Testing, code coverage, quality analysis | Test patterns, bug detection, quality metrics |
| **orchestrator** | Project Manager | Task coordination, delegation, planning | Project coordination, task success/failure patterns |

## 🔧 Configuration

### Agent Profiles
Edit `prompt_profiles/agent_prompt_profiles.json` to customize:
- Agent personalities
- Preferred models
- Prompt templates
- Fallback strategies

### Memory System
The system automatically:
- 🧠 Stores task results in `data/memory/agent_memory.json`
- 🔍 Retrieves relevant memories before each task
- 📈 Learns from successes and failures
- 🔄 Keeps last 50 memories per agent

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (Ready Now)
1. **Test the system:** Run `python integration_patch.py`
2. **Integrate gradually:** Replace one agent method at a time
3. **Monitor results:** Check `data/memory/agent_memory.json` for learning

### Advanced (Optional)
1. **Connect real LLMs:** The system detected your models, just needs API integration
2. **Add feedback loops:** QA agent can trigger retries automatically
3. **GPT-4 override:** Use cloud LLM as "Lead Developer" when available

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If agents seem "dumb"
- Check `prompt_profiles/agent_prompt_profiles.json` for prompt quality
- Verify memory is being loaded in `data/memory/agent_memory.json`
- Test with `python working_agent_upgrade.py` to see mock responses

### If LLM calls fail
- System falls back to mock responses (safe mode)
- Your IntelligentLLMManager was detected and initialized
- LLM integration will be completed when model APIs are connected

### If memory isn't working
- Check that `data/memory/` folder is created and writable
- Memory cache saves automatically after each task
- View memory with: `cat data/memory/agent_memory.json`

## ✅ Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when you see:
- ✅ Agents remembering previous tasks
- ✅ Improved responses over time
- ✅ Memory files growing in `data/memory/`
- ✅ Enhanced logging with memory context
- ✅ Retry logic when tasks fail

Your agent swarm is now ready to become a self-improving, memory-aware development team! 🚀
