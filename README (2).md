# 🧠 AiSource Swarm Upgrade Kit

## ✅ Contents

This upgrade kit includes everything needed to elevate your swarm to a self-correcting, memory-aware, elite-grade AI development team.

### 📁 Files Included

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `agent_upgrade_kit.py` | Main module for enhanced task execution with memory injection, retry logic, and result learning |
| `swarm_runtime_patch.py` | Wrapper for `run_swarm.py` or `orchestrator.py` to use the new agent task engine |
| `prompt_profiles/` | Role-based prompt templates per agent (editable) |
| `tools/gpt_override.py` | GPT-4/Claude fallback leader agent routing |
| `memory_learning_utils.py` | Auto-updater for agent memory profiles with insights, diffs, failures |
| `README.md` | Quickstart integration guide |

## 🧠 Agent Behavior Upgrades

### ✅ Memory-aware prompt construction
### ✅ Retry on failure with fallback model
### ✅ Role-specific tone and behavior
### ✅ Learning loop updates successful strategies
### ✅ Fallback to GPT-4/Claude as lead dev if enabled

## 🛠 Integration Steps

1. Drop `agent_upgrade_kit.py` and `swarm_runtime_patch.py` into your root directory.
2. Modify your `run_swarm.py` or `intelligent_agent_orchestrator.py`:
   ```python
   from swarm_runtime_patch import dispatch_task
   dispatch_task("qa_agent", "Write pytest coverage for api/core endpoint")
   ```
3. Customize prompt templates in `/prompt_profiles/`
4. (Optional) Enable GPT override in config:
   ```json
   { "lead_dev_mode": "gpt4" }
   ```

## 🔁 Future Expansion

- Auto-diff injection
- Prompt tuning based on task failure patterns
- Self-debriefing agents that log reflections
- Daily retraining prompt packs (for few-shot examples)
