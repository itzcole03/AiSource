# Quick Start Guide - Ultimate Copilot Swarm

üöÄ **Get your autonomous copilot swarm running in 30 seconds!**

## TL;DR - Just Run It

1. **Windows**: Double-click `quick_start.bat`
2. **Manual**: Run `python run_swarm.py`
3. Choose mode: Single run (1), Continuous (2), or Interactive (3)

That's it! Your agent swarm is now analyzing and improving your project.

## What This Does

Your Ultimate Copilot starts with 5 specialized agents:

- üß† **Orchestrator**: Coordinates everything
- üèóÔ∏è **Architect**: Analyzes code structure  
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Backend**: Optimizes systems
- üé® **Frontend**: Improves UI/UX
- ‚úÖ **QA**: Tests and validates

## Modes

### 1. Single Run
- Analyzes your workspace once
- All agents report their findings
- Perfect for getting immediate insights

### 2. Continuous Mode  
- Agents keep improving your project
- Runs improvement cycles every 60 seconds
- Press Ctrl+C to stop

### 3. Interactive Mode
- Give direct commands to the swarm
- Type commands, get instant responses
- Type 'quit' to exit

## What Happens Next

The agents will:
1. Analyze your current project
2. Identify areas for improvement
3. Suggest optimizations and fixes
4. In continuous mode: keep improving autonomously

## Technical Notes

- Uses mock LLM responses for immediate testing
- No external API keys required initially
- Designed for 8GB VRAM systems
- All agents run concurrently for speed

## Next Steps

Once basic functionality is confirmed:
1. Connect real LLM providers (Ollama, OpenAI, etc.)
2. Enable editor integrations (Void, VS Code)
3. Add persistent memory and learning
4. Scale up to production workloads

## Troubleshooting

**Python not found?**
- Install Python 3.8+ from python.org
- Make sure it's in your PATH

**Import errors?**
- The swarm uses only built-in Python libraries
- No pip install needed for basic operation

**Need help?**
- Check the logs/ directory for detailed output
- Agents provide helpful error messages
