# Issue: Users need example configs to get started
```

#### 2. **Dependency Management**
```python
# Some optional dependencies could be better organized
# Consider: requirements-minimal.txt for basic functionality
# Consider: requirements-full.txt for all features
```

#### 3. **Error Handling Enhancement**
```python
# Some async operations could benefit from better timeout handling
# WebSocket connections need more robust reconnection logic
```

#### 4. **Documentation Gaps**
- Missing: API documentation for plugin development
- Missing: Troubleshooting guide for common issues
- Missing: Performance tuning guide for different hardware
