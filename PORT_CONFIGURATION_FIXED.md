# üîß PORT CONFIGURATION FIXED!

## ‚úÖ PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED AND RESOLVED

The connectivity issues have been identified and fixed:

### 1. Port Mismatch Fixed ‚úÖ
- **Problem**: Dashboard Backend was trying to connect to Model Manager on port 8080
- **Solution**: Updated `intelligent_model_manager.py` to use port 8002

### 2. Vite Proxy Configuration Fixed ‚úÖ  
- **Problem**: Model Manager Frontend (Vite) was proxying to port 8080
- **Solution**: Updated `vite.config.ts` to proxy all API calls to port 8002

### 3. Deprecation Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Issue**: FastAPI `on_event` is deprecated (non-critical, system still works)
- **Status**: System functional, warning can be ignored for now

## üöÄ RESTART REQUIRED

**You need to restart the services** to apply the port configuration changes:

### Step 1: Stop Current Services
Press `Ctrl+C` in all terminal windows to stop the running services.

### Step 2: Restart Services
Run these commands in 4 separate terminals:

#### Terminal 1 - Model Manager Backend (Port 8002)
```cmd
cd C:\Users\bcmad\OneDrive\Desktop\agentarmycompforbolt\ultimate_copilot
.venv\Scripts\python.exe "frontend\model manager\backend\server_optimized.py" --port 8002
```

#### Terminal 2 - Dashboard Backend (Port 8001)  
```cmd
.venv\Scripts\python.exe "frontend\dashboard_backend_clean.py" --port 8001
```

#### Terminal 3 - Dashboard Frontend (Port 8501)
```cmd
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m streamlit run "frontend\dashboard.py" --server.port 8501
```

#### Terminal 4 - Model Manager Frontend (Port 5173)
```cmd
cd "frontend\model manager"
..\..\nodejs\npm.cmd run dev
```

## ‚úÖ EXPECTED RESULTS

After restarting, you should see:

1. **No more "Error getting model status" messages** - Dashboard Backend will connect to Model Manager Backend successfully
2. **No more Vite proxy errors** - Model Manager Frontend will connect to its backend API  
3. **All services healthy and communicating**

## üåê ACCESS POINTS

Once restarted, these URLs will be fully functional:
- **Main Dashboard**: http://localhost:8501 (with working Model Manager tab)
- **Model Manager UI**: http://localhost:5173 (standalone, now with working API)
- **Dashboard API**: http://localhost:8001/docs  
- **Model Manager API**: http://localhost:8002/docs

## üéØ THE FIX IS COMPLETE

The port configuration mismatch has been resolved. After restarting the services, all components will communicate properly and the Model Manager integration will be fully operational! üöÄ
